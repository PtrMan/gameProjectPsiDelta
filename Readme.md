# about realism: (a love letter to realism)

Other TODO< look up if its the right term >(space combat) games don't care about realism. This was very frustrating as a hard Sci-Fi fan. Physics of most space games looks like a cartoon of the physical real world.

Most of these soft Sci-Fi games which feature various unrelaistic "technologies" which will never be realized, because these are physically impossible, such as:

non-newtonian movement (dogfights, anti-gravity, lack of gravity forces)
Shields / Force-Fields
Warp / teleport / wormholes
unrealistic damage model, with damage types such as "thermal", together with unrealistic scaling of the damage and forces.
smoke and clouds in space
strange space anomalies
dense asteroid fields
dense "nebulae"

The question is then: why care about realism of these things if a computer can simulate anything which doesn't follow any physical laws. A few reasons:

immersion: it breaks immersion if a ship which weights 200 tons quickly stops as if it would be a sub-marine. <br />
plausibility: any knowledge gained by playing the game could be transfered to the physical real world and vice versa. This is NOT the case when the game features ANY physically impossible game mechanics. <br />
extensibility: some parts of the simulation could be used for simulating scientific experiments and vice versa. <br />
